## Description

This repository contains the project "Portable Incubator For Detection Of Coliform In Water Using IoT" created by Olonisakin David and Oguibe Favour. The project focuses on developing a portable incubator device that utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology for the detection of coliform bacteria in water.

## Features

- **IoT Connectivity**: The incubator is equipped with IoT capabilities, allowing real-time data transmission and remote monitoring of incubation processes.

- **Coliform Detection**: The device employs cost-effective techniques for detecting coliform bacteria in water samples, contributing to early water quality assessment.

- **Portability**: The incubator is designed to be easily portable, making it convenient for field applications and areas with limited laboratory infrastructure.
